# rails_recipes
This is a fullstack app using rails and react. The app comes from a tutorial (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-ruby-on-rails-project-with-a-react-frontend) but I refactored it to use async/await and functional components to make it cleaner. Anyone can enter a recipe and view recipes other people have entered
